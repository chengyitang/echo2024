# ECHO â€“ Efficient Capture and Helpful Output
This project aims to build an AI-powered platform that transforms audio and video recordings into useful resources for students, faculty, and team leaders with just one click. Users can upload or record MP3 or MP4 files, and the software will automatically generate detailed transcripts, structured outlines, and various learning or meeting tools such as study guides, test questions, learning objectives, and action items. The platform streamlines tasks like lecture preparation, meeting organization, and exam readiness by utilizing AI. It also offers the flexibility to customize and refine outputs based on individual needs, providing a time-saving solution for both education and professional settings.
